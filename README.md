# OpenTelemetry

High-quality, ubiquitous, and portable telemetry to enable effective observability.

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools. You can use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior. This facilitates seamless integration with various monitoring services, including Datadog, Grafana, Sentry, and New Relic.

## Main Components

OpenTelemetry is currently made up of several main components:

- **Specification:** Describes the cross-language requirements and expectations for all implementations. Beyond a definition of terms, the specification defines the following: API, SDK, and Data.
- **Collector:** It is a vendor-agnostic proxy that can receive, process, and export telemetry data.
- **Language-specific API & SDK implementations** It lets you use the OpenTelemetry API to generate telemetry data with your language of choice and export that data to a preferred backend.
- **K8s operator:** It is an implementation of a Kubernetes Operator. The operator manages the OpenTelemetry Collector and auto-instrumentation of the workloads using OpenTelemetry.
- **Function as a Service assets:** Platforms that enable the development and execution of cloud-based programs. OpenTelemetry's community assets allow you to instrument and gain observability into the features, functions and applications you develop on FaaS platforms.
